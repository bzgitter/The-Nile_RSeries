```

### Description

The time series data is on measurements of the annual flow of the river Nile at Aswan (formerly Assuan), 1871–1970, in 10^8 m^3, “with apparent changepoint near 1898” as stated here (Cobb(1978), Table 1, p.249).

The basic descriptive statistics of the data can be observed from the table next.

```{r Nile, echo = FALSE}
summary(Nile)
```

#### Visualization

The times series data is plotted to visualize the up and down flow changes of the river through those years.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(Nile)
#seasonplot(Nile)
```
